// We need more control over the order that repositories are loaded so we can take constraints into account.
// For example, we need to ensure that the NapUsers table is created before the Tenants table.
// This is because the NapUsers table is used by the Tenants table to store the user_id column.
// Further we need control over which tables are loaded for a tenant so that only the modules they need are deployed
